> **Power should be hidden. Capability should be obvious.**

## 🍈 Why OptiMelon?

Most AI tools act as thin wrappers around a single API or raw playgrounds with too much complexity. OptiMelon takes a different path:
- **Unified System:** Treated as a cohesive workspace, not just a router.
- **Specialized Intelligence:** Access 10+ state-of-the-art open-source models (DeepSeek, Llama 3, etc.) curated for specific tasks.
- **Calm Experience:** A glassmorphism-inspired UI designed for long, focused work sessions.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities
